# Answer

ðŸ¤” Thoughts

> The user is asking me to review the English writing in the selected file and identify sentences that are confusing or hard to follow. I need to analyze the three writing sections (A, B, and C) and provide feedback on clarity, grammar, and readability issues.

Here are the sentences that are confusing or hard to follow in your writing:

## Writing A Issues:
1. **"Last year, I joined in extracurricular education aboaut programming."**
   - "joined in" should be "joined" (remove "in")
   - "aboaut" is misspelled (should be "about")
   - Better: "Last year, I joined an extracurricular programming education program."

## Writing B Issues:
2. **"I'm self-motivated. During my time as a Soongsil University student, I thought that studying only my major would be insufficient for any professional projects."**
   - The connection between these sentences is unclear
   - "any professional projects" is vague
   - Better: "I'm self-motivated. As a Soongsil University student, I realized that studying only my major would be insufficient for future professional work."

3. **"so I decided to develop my skills through extracurricular activities."**
   - Should start with capital "S" as it begins a new sentence
   - Better: "So I decided to develop my skills through extracurricular activities."

4. **"And I recieved top learner award for my performance in the camp."**
   - "recieved" is misspelled (should be "received")
   - Missing article "the" before "top learner award"
   - Better: "I received the top learner award for my performance in the camp."

5. **"Over one and half years, I had learned technical skills and communication skills."**
   - "one and half" should be "one and a half"
   - Tense inconsistency ("had learned" vs. present context)
   - Better: "Over one and a half years, I learned both technical and communication skills."

6. **"We voluntarily participated did them and the increased communication time helped us identify potential issues early and address them promptly."**
   - This sentence is very confusing with grammatical errors
   - "participated did them" doesn't make sense
   - Better: "We voluntarily participated in these meetings, and the increased communication time helped us identify potential issues early and address them promptly."

## Writing C Issues:
7. **"With my technical skills, I can build intuitive automated process and this will ensure the people get access to information with more transparently and reduce potential errors."**
   - "automated process" should be "automated processes" (plural) or "an automated process"
   - "the people" should be "people"
   - "with more transparently" is grammatically incorrect
   - Run-on sentence that's hard to follow
   - Better: "With my technical skills, I can build intuitive automated processes that will help people access information more transparently and reduce potential errors."

8. **"Ultimately, I aim to become an engineer who can enable organization to achieve its maximum productivity with sophisticated system."**
   - "organization" should be "organizations" (plural) or "an organization"
   - "sophisticated system" should be "sophisticated systems" or "a sophisticated system"
   - Better: "Ultimately, I aim to become an engineer who can help organizations achieve maximum productivity through sophisticated systems."

The main issues are: spelling errors, missing articles (a, an, the), grammatical inconsistencies, and some awkward sentence structures that make the meaning unclear.

# Question

Suggest if I use any unnecessary, complicated, or vague words and which words I should replace:
 
# Answer

ðŸ¤” Thoughts

> The user is asking me to review their English writing and suggest improvements for unnecessary, complicated, or vague words. I need to analyze the markdown file that contains three writing samples (Writing A, B, and C) and identify words that could be simplified or made clearer.
> 
> Let me go through each section and identify potential improvements:
> 
> Writing A: This is quite simple and clear already.
> Writing B: This has more complex language that could potentially be simplified.
> Writing C: This also has some potentially complex or vague language.
> 
> I should provide specific suggestions for word replacements that would make the writing clearer and more concise.


After analyzing your writing, here are my suggestions for words that could be simplified or made clearer:

## Writing A
Your first paragraph is already clear and simple - no changes needed!

## Writing B

**Unnecessary/Complicated words to replace:**

1. **"insufficient"** â†’ **"not enough"**
   - Simpler and more direct

2. **"extracurricular activities"** â†’ **"activities outside class"** or **"extra activities"**
   - Less formal, easier to understand

3. **"voluntarily participated"** â†’ **"joined willingly"** or simply **"participated"**
   - "Voluntarily" is redundant since participation implies choice

4. **"address them promptly"** â†’ **"solve them quickly"**
   - More straightforward language

5. **"From this experience, I learned that"** â†’ **"This taught me that"**
   - More concise

## Writing C

**Vague/Complicated words to replace:**

1. **"aspire to be a man"** â†’ **"want to be someone"**
   - More natural phrasing

2. **"communicate more effectively"** â†’ **"communicate better"**
   - Simpler

3. **"intuitive automated processes"** â†’ **"easy-to-use automated systems"**
   - "Intuitive" is vague; be more specific

4. **"access information more transparently"** â†’ **"get information easily"**
   - "Transparently" is unclear in this context

5. **"sophisticated systems"** â†’ **"advanced systems"** or **"well-designed systems"**
   - More specific than "sophisticated"

6. **"achieve maximum productivity"** â†’ **"work more efficiently"**
   - Less business jargon, more natural

**Overall tone suggestion:** Your writing is generally good, but try to use more conversational, direct language instead of formal business terms. This will make your writing more engaging and easier to understand.


âœ“  Task Completed

I've completed the analysis of your English writing and provided specific suggestions for simplifying unnecessary, complicated, or vague words. The main recommendations include:

**Writing B improvements:**
- "insufficient" â†’ "not enough"
- "extracurricular activities" â†’ "extra activities"
- "voluntarily participated" â†’ "participated"
- "address them promptly" â†’ "solve them quickly"
- "From this experience, I learned that" â†’ "This taught me that"

**Writing C improvements:**
- "aspire to be a man" â†’ "want to be someone"
- "communicate more effectively" â†’ "communicate better"
- "intuitive automated processes" â†’ "easy-to-use automated systems"
- "access information more transparently" â†’ "get information easily"
- "sophisticated systems" â†’ "advanced systems"
- "achieve maximum productivity" â†’ "work more efficiently"

Your Writing A was already clear and simple. The overall suggestion is to use more conversational, direct language instead of formal business terms to make your writing more engaging and accessible.

   - More modern and specific than generic "sophisticated"

9. **"maximum productivity"** â†’ **"peak performance"** or **"exceptional efficiency"**
   - More energetic and specific

## Additional Adjective Opportunities:
**Where you could ADD strong adjectives:**

10. **"I'm self-motivated"** â†’ **"I'm highly self-motivated"** or **"I'm incredibly driven"**

11. **"I'm diligent"** â†’ **"I'm exceptionally reliable"** or **"I'm consistently dedicated"**

12. **"programming camp"** â†’ **"intensive programming camp"** or **"rigorous coding bootcamp"**

> I should provide specific suggestions for where these linking phrases would improve the text flow.


âœ“  Task Completed

Here are the sentences that would benefit from linking phrases to improve flow and coherence:

## Writing A:
1. **Between sentences 2-3**: "My university is Soongsil university, and I'm majoring in Industrial Engineering. **Additionally,** last year, I joined an extracurricular programming education program."

## Writing B:
1. **After "not enough for future professional work"**: "So I decided to develop my skills through extra activities. **Therefore,** I joined a programming camp, and I participated in various projects."

2. **Before receiving the award**: "I participated in various projects. **As a result,** I received the top learner award for my performance in the camp."

3. **Between learning skills and looking for challenges**: "Over one and a half years, I learned both technical and communication skills. **Because of this experience,** I'm constantly looking for another challenges and opportunities."

4. **Before the team meeting example**: "So I always try to be punctual and reliable. **For example,** in my last team project, our team had meetings every day."

5. **After describing the meetings**: "We joined willingly in these meetings, and the increased communication time helped us identify potential issues early and solve them quickly. **As a result,** we completed the project ahead of schedule and won 2nd place in the competition."

6. **Before the final lesson**: "As a result, we completed the project ahead of schedule and won 2nd place in the competition. **This experience** taught me that diligence is essential for achieving success and I keep this attitude in all my work."

## Writing C:
1. **Between the two paragraphs**: "With my technical skills, I can build easy-to-use automated systems that will help people get information easily and reduce potential errors. **Building on this foundation,** I aim to become an engineer who can help organizations work more efficiently through advanced systems."

These linking phrases will help create smoother transitions between ideas, clarify cause-and-effect relationships, and make the writing more cohesive and professional.

## Writing A.

Hi, my name is HyungHoon Kim and I'm living in Yongin.
My university is Soongsil university, and I'm majoring in Industrial Engineering.
Last year, I joined in extracurricular education aboaut programming.

## Writing B.

I'm self-motivated. During my time as a Soongsil University student, I thought that studying only my major would be insufficient for any professional projects.
so I decided to develop my skills through extracurricular activities.
I joined a programming camp, and I participated in various projects.
And I recieved top learner award for my performance in the camp.
Over one and half years, I had learned technical skills and communication skills.
Now, for my growth, I'm constantly looking for another challenges and opportunities.

I'm diligent.
I believe the success of projects comes from every member's participation.
So I always try to be punctual and reliable.
In my last team project, our team had meetings every day.
We voluntarily participated did them and the increased communication time helped us identify potential issues early and address them promptly.
As a result, we completed the project ahead of schedule and won 2nd place in the competition.
From this experience, I learned that diligence is essential for achieving success and I keep this attitude in all my work.

## Writing C.

I aspire to be a man who helps people communicate more effectively.
With my technical skills, I can build intuitive automated process and this will ensure the people get access to information with more transparently and reduce potential errors.
Ultimately, I aim to become an engineer who can enable organization to achieve its maximum productivity with sophisticated system.

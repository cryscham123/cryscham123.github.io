## Nonlinear Programming Example

- Pricing
- Inventory
- Portfolio optimization (finance)

   → `Balance` (margin vs price, ordering cost vs inventory cost, return vs risk, ...)

Because `trade off` can only be modeled in a nonlinear way, the programs are by nature `nonlinear`

### Example: Pricing a single good

- A retailer buys one product at a unit cost $c$
- It chooses a unit retail price $p$
- The demand is a function of $p$: $D(p) = a - bp$
- Find profit-maximizing price

\begin{aligned}
\underset{p}{max} \quad  &(p-c)(a-bp) \\
s.t. \quad  &p ≥ 0 \\
\end{aligned}

$$
\text{or}
$$

\begin{aligned}
\underset{p\ge0}{max} \quad  &(p-c)(a-bp) \\
\end{aligned}

$p - c$ is `sales margin`, $a-bp$ is `Demand` (how many sales)

- Parameters

   - $D$: annual demand
   - $K$: unit ordering cost
   - $h$: unit holding cost per year
   - $p$: unit purchasing cost

- Decision varaible

   - $q$: order quantity per order

- Objective: Minimizing annual total cost

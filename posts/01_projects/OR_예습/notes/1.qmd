## Terminology

- process of `fomulating and solving` linear programs
- `mathematical program` with some special properties
   1. objective function
   2. constraints ($b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$)
   3. decision variables ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, x_i ∈ ℝ$)  
      → also expressed as a $x$ that means vector of $n$ variables

### constraints

- Sign constraints: single variable
   - nonnegative: $x_i ≥ 0$
   - nonpositive: $x_i ≤ 0$
   - unrestricted in sign or free: no sign constraints
- Functional constraints: other cases

- equality constraints: $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b$
- inequality constraints: $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n ≤ b$

- binding constraints (or active constraints)  
  no matter $g(x)$ is equality or not, if $g(a) = b, a$ is binding

- strict constraints: $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n < b$
- weak constraints: $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n ≤ b$
   
   → practical mathematical program's inequalities are `all weak`

### solution

- feasible solution: satisfies all constraints
   - feasible region: set of all feasible solutions
- optimal solution: maximizes or minimizes the objective function  
  there may be `multiple` or `no` optimal solutions

## Three types of LPs

1. Infeasible
2. Unbounded: unbounded feasible region `does not imply` an unbounded LP
3. Finitely optimal
   - Unique optimal solutions
   - Multiple optimal solutions

> Parameter: we know. $C_1, C_2, ...$  
> Variables: do not know. $x_1, x_2, ...$

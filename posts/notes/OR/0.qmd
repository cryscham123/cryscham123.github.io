# motivation

1. organizational goals
2. organizational resources

â†’ Resource allocation uses `operational research`

- names of simmilar subjects:
  - management science
  - decision science
  - optimization method/algorithms
  - mathematical programming

# business analytics

- Data Analysis
   1. Descriptive analytics: what happened?
   2. Predictive analytics: what will happen?
- Operational Research
   1. Prescriptive analytics: what should we do? (Allocate resources and solve problems)

## process of conducting an OR study

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  A(Collect data) --> B(Define the problem)
  B --> C{Data are sufficient?}
  C -->|No| A
  C -->|Yes| D(Formulate a model)
  D --> E(Solve the model)
  E --> F{Model is good?}
  F -->|Yes| G(Interpret results make suggestions)
  F -->|No| D
```

### OR cant solve everything

Aim of course: know `what may be solved by OR` and `what cannot be solve by OR`

# mathematical programming

we need Model
1. describe the problem
2. better solution

## model

1. descision variables
2. objective function
3. constraints

### KnapSack(backpack) Problem

1. Linear Programming

\begin{aligned}
max & \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i x_i \\
s.t. & \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \leq B \\
& 0 \leq x_i \leq 1
\end{aligned}

2. Integer Programming

\begin{aligned}
max & \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i x_i \\
s.t. & \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \leq B \\
& x_i \in \{0, 1\}
\end{aligned}

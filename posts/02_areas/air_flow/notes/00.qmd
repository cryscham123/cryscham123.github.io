## What is Airflow

- open source platform to pragramatically author, schedule and monitor workflows

- Not a data processing framework
- Not a Real time streaming solution (only for batch processing)
- Not a data storage system
- and simple linear workflow might overkill

## Why Airflow

1. automation
1. visibility
1. flexibility and scalability
1. extensibility

## Core Components

- Webserver: provides UI
- Scheduler: triggers tasks. ensure that task runs in correct time and order
- meta database: memmory, communication between components
- trigger: daemon that listens to external events and triggers tasks
- executer: traffic controller that decide how tasks are executed (sequential or parallel, local or remote)
- queue
- worker

## Core Concepts

### DAG

- Directed Acyclic Graph
- collection of all the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies
- no cycles in dependencies graph

### Operator

- defines a single task in a workflow
- e.g. BashOperator, PythonOperator, EmailOperator, etc.

### Task / Task Instance

- specific instance of an operator
- when operator assigned to a DAG, it becomes a task

### Workflow

- entire process defined by DAG
- DAG = workflow

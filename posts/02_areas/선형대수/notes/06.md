## Linear independence

### Definition

- Dependence: one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.
- Independence: ⫬ dependence

### Theorem

S = ${v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$

$S$ is linearly dependent ⟺  ∃($c_i$ is not 0) $c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n = 0$ is $c_1 = c_2 = ... = c_n = 0$.

- if $c_1 = c_2 = ... = c_n = 0$, then $S$ is linearly independent.

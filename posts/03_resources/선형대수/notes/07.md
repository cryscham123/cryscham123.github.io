## Subspaces

- $S$ is a subset of $V$.
    1. S ⊆ V
    1. S is a vector space
        1. include zero vector
        1. closed under addition
        1. closed under scalar multiplication

## Basis

- minimum set of vectors that spans the subset
- $S$ is a basis of $V$ ⟺
    1. elements of $S$ are linearly independent
    1. $S$ spans $V$

- 특정 부분집합의 basis의 linear combination으로 표현되는 모든 벡터는 유일하다.

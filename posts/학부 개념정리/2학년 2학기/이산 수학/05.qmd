## Mathematical Induction
### Climbing an Infinite Ladder

1. can reach the first rung
2. if can reach k-th rung, can reach (k+1)-th rung

### Principle of Mathematical Induction

- basis step: prove that the statement is true for n=1
- inductive step: prove that if the statement is true for n=k, then it is true for n=k+1

### Important Points About Using Mathematical Induction
### Proving a Summation Formula by Mathematical Induction
### Conjecturing and Proving Correct a Summation Formula
### Proving Inequalities
### Proving Divisibility Results
### Number of Subsets of a Finite Set(1)

## Strong Induction and Well-Ordering
### Strong Induction

- basis step: prove that the statement is true for n=1
- inductive step: \[P(1) ∧ P(2) ∧ ... ∧ P(k)\] -> P(k+1)

### Proof using Strong Induction(2)
### Proof of Same Example Using Mathematical Induction

## Recursive Definitions and Structural Induction

### Recursively Defined Functions
### Fibonacci Numbers
### Strings

- Σ = {0, 1}, Σ* = {ε(empty string), 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, ...}

### String Concatenation
### Length of a String
### Balanced Parentheses
